            <h2>Google Favors Mobile Performance</h2>
            <p>
                Experience web design that prioritizes mobile devices. Our process begins with mobile compatibility, followed by adaptations for tablets and desktops, guaranteeing a seamless user experience on all platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                By building the website with a mobile first mindset, we ensure the highest performance and page speed scores (by ensuring we are inline with Googles 'Core Vitals'), which help us to rank higher in Google's search algorithm. If you are curious about your current website, <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">try it here</a>. A website made by me will routinely score in the 95+ for speed, and often be 99 or 100%!!
            </p>
            <p>
               Recent studies found that of all the people surveyed, half said theyâ€™d be willing to give up animation and video for faster load times. Furthermore, the highest conversion rates occur on pages with load times between 0-2 seconds. So, speed matters, sometimes even more than cute animations and a flashy video.
            </p>
            <p>
                By compressing images, combined with intelligent use of script and lazy loading techniques, our websites will be optimized to load on a 4G network mobile device, which makes Google happy and gets you infront of more customers.  
            </P>
            <h3>What Makes Our Website Faster Than Others</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Intelligent image hosting, cropping and formatting. Focusing on page loading speed.</li>
                <li>Not having bloated, extra code that creeps into wordpress or other template style web designs.</li>
                <li>Ensuring the pages are ensitrely responsive. Not just formatted for a desk top and iphone, but any screen size in between.</li>
            </ul>
