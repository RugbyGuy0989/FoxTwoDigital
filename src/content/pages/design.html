            <h2>Google Favors Mobile Performance</h2>
            <p>
                Experience web design that prioritizes mobile devices. Our process begins with mobile compatibility, followed by adaptations for tablets and desktops, guaranteeing a seamless user experience on all platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                By building the website with a mobile first mindset, we ensure the highest performance and page speed scores (by ensuring we are inline with Googles 'Core Vitals'), which help us to rank higher in Google's search algorithm. If you are curious about your current website, <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">try it here</a>. A website made by me will routinely score in the 95+ for speed, and often be 99 or 100%!!
            </p>
            <p>
               Recent studies found that of all the people surveyed, half said they’d be willing to give up animation and video for faster load times. Furthermore, the highest conversion rates occur on pages with load times between 0-2 seconds. So, speed matters, sometimes even more than cute animations and a flashy video.
            </p>
            <p>
                By compressing images, combined with intelligent use of script and lazy loading techniques, our websites will be optimized to load on a 4G network mobile device, which makes Google happy and gets you infront of more customers. Overtime, a faster website will help you to rank higher in the local search results. 
            </P>
            <h3>What Makes Our Website Faster Than Others</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>By hand-coding, I don't have to rely on javascript to do things for me. Extra javascript slows pages down.</li>
                <li>Intelligent image hosting, cropping and formatting. Focusing on page loading speed.</li>
                <li>Not having bloated, extra code that creeps into wordpress or other template style web designs.</li>
                <li>Ensuring the pages are ensitrely responsive. Not just formatted for a desk top and iphone, but any screen size in between.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="cs-text">
                If a hand-coded website is out of your price range right now, we can use a templated website builder, such as Wix, WordPress or other builder, to make you a website in around 24 hours. 
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Sometimes simple is the best option. The drag and drop website won't rank as high due to speed issues, but a hand-coded website can take 30+ hours of coding and over 10,000 lines of code. 
            </p>
             <p class="cs-text">
                We can make a logo, pick a color pallate and create a basic website for you in less than 24 hours. Then, over the next week, we can get more information to fill out pertinent information for your services.

                            Google wants to see enagement on your profile. This involves updating pictures, responding to reviews, adding updates and events, a FAQ section, keeping business hours updated (including holiday hours), responding to messages and making posts to your profile. All of these show Google you are interacting with customers, and Google wants to send customers to businesses who will interact with them.

                            Having a professionally written blog allows you to target keywords that are related to your business, but not appropriate for certain areas of your website. For example, an electrician might want to have a blog post about how different plug types should be used, spaced and wired during a kitchen remodel for best layout and to "future proof" thier kitchen for further updates. This allows the natural tie in of "kitchen remodeling" to thier website, so if someone were to Google "kitchen remodeling near me", now they can get into those results, when they normally wouldn't have.

                            Your engagement is not for your current customers, its for your future ones. Think about how many people were at a Thanksgiving or Christmas parade in your city this year. By finding and sharing the event page for that parade, you have found something useful to people near you, and your customer base will share it (because its useful) for you, with no ads. This is the step most marketing agencies miss.
